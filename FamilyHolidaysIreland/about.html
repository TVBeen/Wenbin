                        <a>YOUR TOUR DIRECTOR</a><p>FAMILY HOLIDAYS IRELAND Tours could not exist without our great locally employed tour directors they are the envy of the travel industry. From the moment you land in Ireland, your tour director is there to welcome you, handle your luggage, drive you from place to place and give you a daily commentary. Tour directors make history and culture come alive and create a superb experience with daily doses of humour, information and assistance.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h3>Hotels</h3>                        
                        <a>YOUR HOTELS</a><p>FAMILY HOLIDAYS IRELAND Tours uses three classes of hotels first class (3-star), superior first class (4-star) or deluxe (5-star) properties on all tours. First class hotels feature a dining room, lounge, bar and comfortable rooms with many facilities. Superior first class hotels offer the same amenities with higher standards and many have leisure and spa facilities. Deluxe hotels offer luxurious features and are often in unique settings. We choose hotels in central locations or scenic regions and we name the hotels we use on each tour. Our website contains photos and detailed descriptions of each property.</p>
                        <a>HOTEL ARRIVALS</a><p>When you travel as a group you benefit from speedy check-ins. On arrival at a hotel your tour director will announce your room number and you just pick up the key at the front desk. On departure you pay for phone calls, drinks or other extras. As check-in time is from 1:00 to 3:00 pm, rooms may not be available when you get to the hotel early.</p>
                       

                        <a>LIVE LIKE A QUEEN OR KING</a><p>For a royal experience, choose one of our deluxe tours where you can stay in 5-star properties including Ashford Castle or Dromoland Castle. Many other tours stay in 4-star castle hotels such as Clontarf, Cabra or Kilronan Castle, giving you the experience for a more moderate cost. We feature Bunratty, Knappogue or Cardiff Castle Banquets on a number of tours and all itineraries visit plenty of castles throughout Ireland and Britain.</p>
                        <a>BAGGAGE HANDLING</a><p>Once you meet your tour director, you don't have to handle your luggage! At every hotel your suitcase is delivered to your bedroom door and collected on departure. However, luggage is restricted to one suitcase and one piece of carry-on baggage per person.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Meals</h3>                        
                        <a>BREAKFASTS & DINNERS</a><p>Every morning a full cooked breakfast is served in your hotel to get your day off to a good start. In hotels a table dhote dinner is served. This is a 4-course meal with 2 to 5 choices of appetizers, entrees and desserts followed by tea or coffee. Special requests for vegetarian or low fat meals should be made directly to the hotel and can be arranged easily. Usually you will have one or two free evenings in Dublin, Killarney, London or Edinburgh where you will find a wide range of restaurants. Lunch stops are at self-service restaurants so that you can choose what you like and save valuable time for sightseeing or in towns where you can find a friendly bar and choose pub grub, casual dishes of many kinds.</p>
                        <a>SPECIAL EVENINGS</a><p>All of our tours highlight a number of great evenings to enhance your holiday. These experiences enable you to sample local foods and enjoy special entertainment. Depending on the tour you choose, you may attend a fun banquet in historic places such as Bunratty, Knappogue.
